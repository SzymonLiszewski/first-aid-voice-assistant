# Knowledge base

Vetted first-aid and emergency-medicine knowledge that the assistant relies on. Shared by the PoC and the target application. The assistant suggests only steps that exist here.

| Path | Content | In git |
|---|---|---|
| `scenarios/` | Machine-readable rules in YAML: `actions.yaml` (dictionary of rescue actions) and one file per scenario | yes |
| `sources/` | Optional descriptions of the source documents, one YAML file per document (see below) | yes, when added |
| `raw/` | Original documents (guidelines, procedures, training materials) | **no** – may be under licences that forbid redistribution |

## Principles

- Scenarios are state machines: steps, transition conditions (e.g. "is the person breathing?") and separate content for laypeople and paramedics. Timers (e.g. changing the person doing compressions) are planned.
- The action dictionary gives every action a code, a name, a level (layperson / paramedic) and colloquial synonyms (e.g. "uciskam", "masaż serca", "RKO"). The same codes are used in the event log and in the reference logs in `eval/`.
- Steps should refer to the source (document and section) they come from.
- Rules should be reviewed by a medical professional before they are used in an evaluation.

## Scenarios

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `actions.yaml` | Actions: `code` (e.g. `CHEST_COMPRESSIONS`), Polish `name`, `level`, colloquial `synonyms` |
| `adult-bls.yaml` | Adult cardiac arrest: check safety and response, call 112, check breathing, AED, compressions, rescue breaths 30:2 for trained rescuers |
| `adult-choking.yaml` | Adult choking: cough, 5 back blows, 5 abdominal thrusts, alternating, CPR when the person becomes unresponsive |

A scenario has `id`, `title`, `trigger` (when to choose it), `level`, `start` and a list of `steps`. A step has:

- `instructions` – what to say, one at a time (Polish, numbers in words because the answer is read aloud);
- `asks` – an optional question asked after the instructions;
- `actions` – codes from `actions.yaml` the rescuer may perform in this step;
- `transitions` – `when` (a condition, in Polish) and `goto` (a step) or `handoff` (`scenario/step`); a step without transitions ends the scenario;
- `sources` – optional citations, see below;
- `note` – where the step goes beyond the guideline, for reviewers.

The server (`poc/server/app/knowledge/`) validates the files at start-up and refuses to start when a transition, action or (if source files are present) citation does not exist, or a step is unreachable. It walks through a scenario one instruction at a time and shows the model only the current one.

## Sources

A source file has `id`, `title`, `publisher`, `version`, `published`, `urls`, `accessed` (access date), `scope` (layperson / paramedic), `raw` (file names in `raw/`), `sections` (the sections that steps may cite) and optional `notes`. A step cites a source with `source` (the `id`) and `section` (listed in the source; it may continue with ` – <detail>`). The citations are checked only when `sources/` has files.

## Status

Two draft scenarios (adult BLS with AED, adult choking) based on the ERC 2025 guidelines and materials of the Polish Resuscitation Council (PRR). Their citations name those documents, but the `sources/` descriptions are not added yet – they come when the procedures are completed. **Not yet reviewed by a medical professional**; the points to check are in the `note` fields and in the comment at the top of `adult-choking.yaml` (the guideline calls the emergency number only after the first round of back blows and abdominal thrusts; the project rule is to call first).
