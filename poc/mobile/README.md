# PoC mobile app

Demo mobile app of the first-aid voice assistant (Flutter, Android and iOS). **Status:** the start screen and on-device speech recognition work – the test conversation shows every utterance as a separate message with its time. Three speech engines can be compared on the phone (Parakeet, Vosk, Whisper). Next: answers from the server and reading them aloud. Why Flutter: [ADR 0001](../../docs/adr/0001-flutter-for-mobile-app.md).

| Package | `first_aid_voice_assistant` |
| Android application ID | `io.github.szymonliszewski.first_aid_voice_assistant` |
| iOS bundle ID | `io.github.szymonliszewski.firstAidVoiceAssistant` |
| Platforms | Android (arm64 phones), iOS (not built yet; needs a Mac with Xcode) |

## Scope of the demo

The demo checks that a voice conversation with the assistant works end to end.

| Screen / step | Status |
|---|---|
| **Start** – "demo version" banner, what the demo checks, button to the test conversation | done |
| **Test conversation** – tap to start, speak with pauses, tap to stop; text appears while speaking, every utterance becomes a message with its time and timings | done (user messages only) |
| Answers from the [PoC server](../server), read aloud | next |
| **Settings** – speech engine (Parakeet, Vosk, Whisper tiny / base / small) | done |
| Settings – server address, voice check | planned |

## Speech engines

All engines run on the phone and work offline after a one-time download.

| Engine | Library | Download | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Parakeet v3** (default) | [sherpa-onnx](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx) | ~670 MB | NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3, int8; 25 European languages, with punctuation |
| **Vosk small-pl** | [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) | ~53 MB (zip) | streaming, text appears immediately, no punctuation |
| **Whisper tiny / base / small** | [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) | ~33 / 61 / 191 MB | quantised (q5_1), tuned for speed |

Parakeet and Whisper also download the Silero voice activity detector (~0.6 MB), which finds speech in the recording.

## Setup (once)

1. Install the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/archive) (stable), unpack it to a folder without spaces (e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\dev\flutter`) and add its `bin` folder to `PATH`.
2. Install the Android SDK with **Android SDK Platform 37.0**, **Android SDK Command-line Tools** and **NDK (Side by side) 29** (Android Studio → SDK Manager → "Show Package Details"). The NDK compiles the native speech libraries.
3. In VS Code install the **Flutter** extension.
4. Check the setup: `flutter doctor` – *Flutter* and *Android toolchain* must be green.

## Running

All commands are run from `poc/mobile/`.

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run --release
```

In VS Code: pick the device in the status bar and press F5. Use a **real arm64 phone** (USB debugging on): the speech libraries ship no x86 build for the emulator, and the emulator's microphone and performance do not reflect real use. Measure speed in release (or profile) mode – debug builds are several times slower.

Server address (for the next step): from an Android emulator `http://10.0.2.2:8000`, from a physical phone the computer's LAN address.

## First run

- The speech engine is chosen in **Settings** (default: Parakeet v3). When the test conversation opens with an engine that is not on the phone yet, the app downloads it once with a progress bar (use Wi-Fi for Parakeet); interrupted downloads resume and every file is checked against its size and SHA-256.
- The app asks for microphone access on the first tap of the talk button.
- iOS: the deployment target is 15.6. When CocoaPods creates `ios/Podfile` on a Mac, set `platform :ios, '15.6'` there too. The iOS build has not been tried yet.

## Checks

```bash
dart format .
flutter analyze
flutter test
```
