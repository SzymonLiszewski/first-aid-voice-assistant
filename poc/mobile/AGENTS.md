# PoC mobile app – agent instructions

Project-wide rules (language, domain and safety, data, documentation) are in the root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md); this file adds the rules specific to the mobile app. Run all commands from `poc/mobile/`.

Status: start screen, on-device speech recognition with three selectable engines (Parakeet via sherpa-onnx, Vosk, Whisper via whisper.cpp), answers from the PoC server over a WebSocket, read aloud sentence by sentence while they are streamed (system voice or Piper). The user and the assistant take turns.

## Safety in this part

- The "call 112" button is always visible and works without the backend.
- When the server is unreachable or returns an error, the app says so plainly and points the user to 112. It never shows an invented instruction.
- The app must not take its own voice for the user's words: the microphone is off while the app speaks (it stops by itself after the user's turn). Listening while speaking needs working echo cancellation, checked on real phones, before it comes back.

## Rules

- Requests to the server and responses from it follow the server API (Pydantic models in `poc/server`, browsable at `/docs` of the running server). Event-log entries follow `docs/project/architecture.md`.
- Event timestamps are taken at the **end of the utterance**, not when the server answers – otherwise server latency distorts the times compared with the reference log in the evaluation.
- The state of the action (conversation, event history, current scenario step) is kept in the app and sent with every request; the server does not keep sessions. An interrupted answer goes into the history only as far as it was spoken.
- Model files (speech recognition and voice weights) are not committed; their URLs, sizes and SHA-256 checksums are pinned in `lib/domain/models/speech_engine.dart` and `voice_engine.dart` and listed in `README.md`.
- No comments in `lib/`; the code should explain itself through names. Non-obvious build workarounds in `android/` keep a short comment.
- Coding conventions: [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md).

## Definition of done

`flutter analyze` and `flutter test` pass, the code is formatted with `dart format`, and `README.md` / `docs/` are updated if the structure or behaviour changed.
