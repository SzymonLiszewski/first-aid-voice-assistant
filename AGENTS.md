# First-aid voice assistant – project-wide rules

These rules apply to the whole repository, for people and coding agents alike. Each part has its own `AGENTS.md` with the rules specific to it:

- `poc/server/AGENTS.md` – test server (Python, FastAPI)
- `poc/mobile/AGENTS.md` – demo mobile app (Flutter)

Read the `AGENTS.md` of the part you are changing before you start.

## Project

A voice assistant for emergencies and first aid. It listens to the person giving help (a paramedic or a layperson), recognises the rescue actions they perform, records them with timestamps in an event log and prompts the next steps according to prepared scenarios. It is a master's thesis project and a research prototype, not a medical device.

Overview, requirements and architecture: `docs/project/`.

## Domain and safety

- The assistant must never be the only way to get help: every client shows a "call 112" fallback when the backend is unreachable or returns an error.
- Safety rules live in the system prompts (call 112 first, rescuer safety first, no diagnoses, no drug dosing, never invent procedures, one short instruction at a time). Do not weaken or remove them; any prompt change must be re-checked against them and, ideally, reviewed by a medical professional.
- The assistant suggests only steps that exist in the knowledge base (`knowledge/`). Medical facts must come from vetted sources, not from the model's memory.
- The model must not simply agree with the user: it checks what the user says against the scenario and corrects it when needed.
- Prefer failing loudly over guessing: an honest "I don't know, call 112" beats a confident wrong answer.

## Repository layout

- `docs/` – project documentation (`project/`, `adr/`, `consultations/`)
- `poc/` – proof of concept: `server/`, `mobile/`
- `apps/` – target application (not started)
- `knowledge/` – knowledge base shared by all parts
- `eval/` – evaluation datasets, scripts and results

## Rules

- **Language:** everything is in English – code, comments, commit messages, pull requests and all documentation (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, every `docs/` folder). Only end-user-facing content (system prompts, domain glossaries) may be in Polish.
- **Secrets** live only in `.env` files, never in code or configs; each part keeps a `.env.example`.
- **Data:** evaluation recordings and raw source documents are not committed (`eval/datasets/`, `knowledge/raw/` are git-ignored) – they may contain personal data or be under licences that forbid redistribution.
- **API:** the API used by the mobile app is defined by the server's Pydantic models (browse it at `/docs` of the running server). A change to it updates the mobile app in the same pull request. The event-log entry format, shared with the evaluation, is described in `docs/project/architecture.md`.
- **Documentation:** documents in `docs/` folders carry the metadata header and revision history described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Update the docs of the part you change in the same pull request.
- Git workflow (branches, commits, pull requests): `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Skills

Project-wide skills live in `.claude/skills/`; skills of a single part live in that part's `.claude/skills/` (e.g. `poc/server/.claude/skills/`).

- `consultation-note` – turns raw notes from a supervisor consultation (usually in Polish) into `docs/consultations/YYYY-MM-DD.md`: English, no third-party names, action items listed.
